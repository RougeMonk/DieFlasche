BOTTLE.

George Thorogood sings it best...
In his power ballad "I drink alone".
" Yeah the other night I was a sleepin.
I woke from a terrible dream.
So I called pal Jack Daniels
and his partner Jimmi Dean
And we drank alone
Yeah with nobody else
Yeah when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself.

Poor Georgie boy!  I want to introduce your to a guy named Felix Klein (1849-1925).

A mathematician named Klein
Thought the Mobius strip was divine.
Said he, "If you glue
The edges of two
You'll get a weird bottle like mine.
